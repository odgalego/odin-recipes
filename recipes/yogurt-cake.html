    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A lemon pound cake made with yogurt instead of sour cream. I have used this recipe for a long time and had misplaced it. I went to my daughter and had her give me another copy.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup butter, room temperature</li>
        <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>3 eggs, room temperature</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lemon extract</li>
        <li>2 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) container lemon flavored yogurt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10-inch bundt pan.</li>
        <li>Beat butter and sugar together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Beat one egg at a time into the butter mixture; add lemon extract with last egg.</li>
        <li>Sift together the flour, baking soda and salt. Alternately mix in the flour mixture and the yogurt, starting and ending with the dry ingredients. Beat just until incorporated.</li>
        <li>Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool 10 minutes in the pan, then turn out onto a wire rack and cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
